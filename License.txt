Following is the description of the licenses which are used for the softwares being used in our project :

Free Software License : It is a notice which grants the user of a software piece to modify that software. These actions are generally
                                           restricted by the copyright law but these restrictions can be removed by the author of that software by 
                                           adding software license with that software to enable any user of that software to modify it. 
                                           The software using such a license is called Free Software.

GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL)  :  It is basically a type of free software license. It is most widely used free software
                                           due to which a user (an individual or company or organisation) of a particular software is granted the
		       freedom to study, share or copy and modify that software. This license gives the users of a computer                                            program  the rights of "Free Software Definition" which itself defines free software as the one which enables
                                           its users to use, study, share and modify that software thereby giving users liberty.

Apache License :             It is a free software license which is written by Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Similar to any free 
                                           license, it gives liberty to user of Apache Software to use the software for any purpose, to modify it and also
		       to distribute the modified versions of software under the terms of license.

Apache License 2.0 :      This version of Apache License was adopted by ASF  in January 2004. The goals of this license included
		       making it easier for non-ASF projects to use and improving comapatibility with GPS-based software.
